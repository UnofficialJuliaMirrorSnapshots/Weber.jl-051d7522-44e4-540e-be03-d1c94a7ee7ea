Visual display is largely handled by the methods defined in
[`Images`](http://juliaimages.github.io/latest/). However, this objects must be
prepared by Weber using [`visual`](@ref) and then a call to [`display`](@ref) is
made to show the visual. The call to [`visual`](@ref) is normally handled
automatically for you when you call [`moment`](@ref).
